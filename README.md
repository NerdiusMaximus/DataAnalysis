# DataAnalysis
Matlab code for analysis of the data for the Knee Stability rig (Air Bearing Rig)
The code will be disigned to enable to user to specify a folder, iteratively open each excel workbook,
iteratively collect the data from each sheet and store it in a matrix for that variable. The matrix will expand with each iteration.
Knowing the order the variables entered they could be indexed and references for analysis and graphing.
